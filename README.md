# Joomla Maintainer Manual

**You are maintaining – or going to maintain – a Joomla project?
First of all, thank you for volunteering to take on such an important task!**

In this manual, we try to provide you with all the information you need to succeed.

You won't find general instructions on developing or setting up tools like Git or PHPStorm here, though; there's plenty
of information on that in the [Documentation Portal](https://docs.joomla.org/Portal:Joomla!_Code_Contributors/en).
